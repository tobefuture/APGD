# APGD v.0.1.0

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The Accelerated Proximal Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm is a R package to solve the penalized regression models, including 

- **HuberNet**: Huber loss function along with Network-based penalty function;
- **HuberLasso**: Huber loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **HuberENET**: Huber loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **ENET**: Mean square error loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **Lasso**: Mean square error loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **Net**: Mean square error loss function along with Network-based penalty function.

## Installation

You can install the released version of APGD from Github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("xueweic/APGD")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(APGD)
#> Loading required package: igraph
#> Warning: package 'igraph' was built under R version 3.6.3
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'igraph'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     decompose, spectrum
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     union
#> Loading required package: Matrix
#> Loading required package: mvtnorm
#> Loading required package: MASS
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
